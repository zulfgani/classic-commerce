- Run `git clone https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/classic-commerce`
- Run `cd classic-commerce`
- Run `composer install`
- Run `npm install`

## Testing the development builds

As we push the plugin to a better version of itself, testing the plugin is of great help. We recommend
- A fresh installation of ClassicPress or WordPress
- A fresh installation of Classic Commerce in your `\wp-content\plugins` folder 
- Activate the plugin and begin tests.
